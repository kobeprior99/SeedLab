Blane:
- Adjusted arrow function to only send contours we are more confident about.
    - Used if-statements to define a region of interest around the marker, ensuring that, for example, red detected in a specific region actually means to turn right.

Kobe:
- Scaled Aruco detection to store multiple markers' data in lists for processing.
    - Identified the closest marker and sent its data.
- Used Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to handle lighting variations.

Joint Tasks:
- Integrated individual subsystems into a single program.

Intersubsystem Tasks:
- Verified that the program functions correctly with the controls subsystem.
