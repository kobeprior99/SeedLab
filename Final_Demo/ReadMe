# Project Directory Overview

This document provides an overview of the directories and key files in the project.

## Directories and Files

### Computer_Vision
This directory contains files related to the computer vision subsystem.

- **`calibration.pkl`**  
    A file generated by `Demo1/Computer_Vision/cam_cal.py` that stores camera calibration data for use in the program.

- **`FinalDemo.py`**  
    The main project file that calculates the angle and distance to several ArUco markers. It reports the angle and distance of the closest marker to the Arduino via I2C. When close enough, it also identifies the arrow near the ArUco marker as either red (right) or green (left).

- **`leftarrow.pdf`**  
    A printable file containing the left beacon.

- **`projectBoard.txt`**  
    A text file listing tasks for the computer vision subsystem.

- **`refined_aruco_detection`**  
    An experimental file testing adaptive thresholding to reduce environmental influence on ArUco detection. This is not the final solution.

- **`rightarrow.pdf`**  
    A printable file containing the right beacon.

### Control
This directory contains files related to the control subsystem.

- **`Final_Demo.ino`**  
    The main project file implementing a finite state machine (FSM) with proportional-derivative (PD) control to autonomously navigate a course of beacons. It processes input from the Raspberry Pi via I2C.

- **`projectBoard.txt`**  
    A text file listing tasks for the control subsystem.
