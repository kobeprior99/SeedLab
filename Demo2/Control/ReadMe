## Files and Descriptions

### **FSM.JPG**
- This file contains the initial ideation for the FSM design, showcasing the states and transitions based on computer vision parameters.

### **Revised_FSM**
- This file presents a revised version of the FSM with fewer states, which was ultimately implemented in the program for improved efficiency and simplicity.

## Related Files in Demo2 Directory

### **Demo2.ino**
- This file contains the robot control system code. The robot performs the following tasks:
    - Sweeps the area to identify a marker.
    - Drives towards the marker.
    - Stops within 1.5 feet of the marker.
    - Based on instructions, either stays in place or turns 90 degrees.
- Example excecution listed in the file

## Additional Notes
- The FSM design is a critical component of the robot's control system, enabling it to make decisions based on real-time computer vision inputs.
- Refer to `FSM.JPG` and `Revised_FSM` for a visual representation of the FSM design process.
