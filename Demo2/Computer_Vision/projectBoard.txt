Blane Tasks: develop distance detection code
Kobe Tasks: develop arrow detection code, implement send function to pack bytes and send via i2c to arduino
Joint Tasks: Co-program demo2 combining results from demo1 and individual tasks above

Revision tasks:
Blane: thread send instructions to send at a slightly slower rate without degrading program performance
Kobe: implement manual exposure and adjust green and red masks accordingly

Cross disciplinary:
Computer Vision both memebers: help control team implement receive function: file `Test_Send.ino`

Post Demo Revision:
Blane: experiment with adaptive thresholding for aruco detection to make it more resilient to lighting changes
Kobe:
