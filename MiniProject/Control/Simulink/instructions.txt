/*
 * Instructions for Mini Project:
 * 
 * 1. Ensure you have Simulink and the Control Design Toolbox installed.
 * 
 * 2. Initialize motor parameters:
 *    - Run motorSim_stepTest.m to initialize K and sigma in the MATLAB workspace.
 *    - For motor 1: K = 1.5, sigma = 14, Kp = 1.75.
 *    - For motor 2: K = 1.75, sigma = 14, Kp = 2.
 *    - Modify stepData1 and data1 to stepData2 and data2 for motor 2 in the stepTest file.
 * 
 * 3. Open PID_motor_controller.slx simulation:
 *    - Double-click on the PI controller block.
 *    - Click the "tune" button to open the steady-state response graph.
 *    - Click "tune" and then "update block" to get MATLAB's suggested values.
 *    - Switch values to the P and I values located in the PID Controller Charts pdf on whichever table corresponds to the motor you're using
 *    - the values Simulink gives will be significantly off because it doesn't take into account that the motors cannot respond and rotate fully in 0.08 seconds
 * Note: The files will not work without Simulink and the Control Design Toolbox.
