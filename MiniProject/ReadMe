Deliverable Goals: 

Computer Vision: 
detect aruco marker and the quadrant that it is in. Report this data to Arduino via I2C
top left quadrant (0,0)
top right quadrant (1,0)
bottom left quadrant (0,1)
bottom right quadrant (0,0)

Control:
Two wheel positions 0 and 1 seperated by 180 degrees
Turn the left wheel to x coordinate of the quadrant reported by raspberry pi
Turn the right wheel to y coordinate of the quadrant reported by raspberry pi
