Demo Goals: 

Computer Vision: 
-accurately determine the angle of the robot relative to the target

images folder contains the images from take_photo.py which will be used in cam_cal.py to get camera intrinsic parameters
remote start folder contains sample code for controls team to take data from pi via i2c in float array format.
    -using_remote_start.ino interprets float array sent from raspberry pi
    -remote_start.py sends inches and angle to pi via i2c in float array
blanetest.py is Demo1.py fork used to collab in parallel.
calibration.pkl is a file for us to read calibration parameters that were generated from cam_cal.py
cam_cal.py reads photos of checker board from images folder to generate camera intrinsic parameters and store them in calibration.pkl
Demo1.py is the final code to detect angle of center of marker relative to camera and report it on LCD screen
take_photo.py takes a photo every time you press S until you quit and stores it all into the images folder


Controls and Localization: 
-Drive straight a specified distance
-Turn a specified angle then drive a specified distance

Demo1 folder contains Demo1.ino code which drives the robot straight or rotates an angle then go straight
