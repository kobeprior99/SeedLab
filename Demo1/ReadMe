Demo Goals: 

Computer Vision: 
-accurately determine the angle of the robot relative to the target

Controls and Localization: 
-Drive straight a specified distance
-Turn a specified angle then drive a specified distance


### File Descriptions:

- **images/**: Contains images captured by `take_photo.py` for camera calibration.
- **remote_start/**: Contains code for remote starting and data transmission via I2C.
    - **using_remote_start.ino**: Interprets float array sent from Raspberry Pi.
    - **remote_start.py**: Sends distance and angle data to Raspberry Pi via I2C.
- **blanetest.py**: A fork of `Demo1.py` for collaborative development.
- **calibration.pkl**: Stores camera calibration parameters generated by `cam_cal.py`.
- **cam_cal.py**: Generates camera intrinsic parameters from checkerboard images.
- **Demo1.py**: Detects the angle of the marker relative to the camera and displays it on an LCD screen.
- **take_photo.py**: Captures and stores images in the `images` folder upon pressing 'S'.
- **Demo1.ino**: Drives the robot straight or rotates it by a specified angle before driving straight.
