**File Name:** `Demo1Demo1_after_spring_break.ino`

## Description
Drive straight and turn an angle, then drive straight.

## Follow these steps to set up and run Demo 1:

1. **Connect:**
    - I2C Pi -> Arduino
        - Connect pin 3 on Pi to pin A4 on Arduino (SDA)
        - Connect pin 5 on Pi to pin A5 on Arduino (SCL)
        - Connect pin 6 on Pi to GND on Arduino

2. **Power Up the Robot:**
    - Plug in the battery pack and place it near the front of the robot, close to the camera.
    - Use the battery taped to the robot to activate the Raspberry Pi (PI).
    - Flip the switch to activate the Arduino.

3. **Upload Code:**
    - Upload `Demo1_after_spring_break.ino` to the Arduino.
    - Upload `remote_start.py` to the PI.

4. **Position the Robot:**
    - Place the robot slightly behind the desired starting position.
    - Push the robot forward to the exact starting position.

5. **Initialize the Robot:**
    - Press the reset button on the Arduino.
    - Use the PI terminal to input the turn angle first, followed by the distance to travel.

The robot will begin moving after a short delay and should reach the intended destination.
