# backupDemo.ino

## Description
This file modifies the Rho controller of `Demo1.ino` and implements remote start code proposed in `Demo1/Computer_Vision/Remote_Start/using_remote_start.ino`. The control constants must be modified to produce a more stable controller.

## Example Execution

### Connect:
- I2C Pi -> Arduino
    - Connect pin 3 on Pi to pin A4 on Arduino (SDA)
    - Connect pin 5 on Pi to pin A5 on Arduino (SCL)
    - Connect pin 6 on Pi to GND on Arduino

### Steps:
1. Turn the power switch to the on position.
2. Run `remote_start.py` found in `Demo1/Computer_Vision/Remote_Start`.
3. Type angle and distance.
