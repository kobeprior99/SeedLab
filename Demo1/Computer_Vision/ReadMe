## Directory Structure and Files

### Images Directory
- **Description**: Contains 135 images of a checkerboard for camera calibration.
- **Generated By**: `cam_cal.py`

### Remote Start Directory
- **Description**: Contains code to run Demo1 remotely using I2C from Raspberry Pi to Arduino with angle and distance input.
- **Includes**: Sample code for implementation on Arduino.

### Files

#### `blanetest.py`
- **Description**: Experimental fork of `Demo1.py` to facilitate quick development and experimentation.

#### `calibration.pkl`
- **Description**: Calibration file containing camera intrinsic parameters, camera matrix, and distortion coefficients.
- **Usage**: Used in other programs for camera calibration.

#### `cam_cal.py`
- **Description**: Reads images from the images directory to generate the camera calibration file `calibration.pkl`.

#### `Demo1.py`
- **Description**: Main code to achieve deliverables assigned, including computing the angle from the camera Z-axis to the center of the ArUco marker.

#### `take_photo.py`
- **Description**: Takes a photo and stores it in the images folder every time the 's' key is clicked.
- **Usage**: Used to generate photos for camera calibration with low mean error.
