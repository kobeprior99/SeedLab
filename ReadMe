Guidlines and Tips
-Using GitHub: Download GitHub Desktop as well as add github extension to VScode, need help ask Kobe

-Enable AutoFetch so current repo is accessible locally: "file>Preferences>settings" then search "Git: Auto Fetch and toggle it on"

-When you've made changes stage the changes with the plus button and commit leaving a message about what you changed

-Please produce well commented code for project implementation. 

-Develop code however you want but be sure it is commented well when it will be used by the group

-Try to have as much fun as possible

-Need new eyes on your code ask on snap if anyone is willing to help but give a good college try first

-Important deliverables deadlines will be filled in on TEAMS calendar -> we can explore with using gannt charts with dependencies if you guys want to as well

-The use of generative AI is only banned for reflection logs and discussions. Use GenAI to speed up coding and research. VS code as free copilot available and you can tab lines and lines of code to save a bunch of time. ChatGPT also an option
